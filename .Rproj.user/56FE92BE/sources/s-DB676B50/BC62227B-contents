# Methods
We report how we determined our sample size, all data exclusions (if any), all manipulations, and all measures in the study. <!-- 21-word solution (Simmons, Nelson & Simonsohn, 2012; retrieved from http://ssrn.com/abstract=2160588) -->

## Participants

## Material

## Procedure

Assess retention of new words with various intervals between training and test. Children receive all conditions 1-2 weeks apart
1. after a 5 min delay
2. after a nap (4 hour delay)
3. after 24 hours

## Data analysis
The first analysis conducted was a repeated measures ANOVA for both wake and nap conditions. The second was a 2x2 ANOVA with delay type as the repeated factor and TD or DS as the between. These were conducted for the 4 and 24 hour delay.

We used `r cite_r("r-references.bib")` for all our analyses.
