abstract: |
  Naps are beneficial for learning in typically developing infants, children, and adults. They show greater retention when a delay between training and test contains sleep then when it is a comparable period of wake. However, individuals with Down syndrome have a high rate of disordered sleep than seen in the typical population. Do they experience the same benefits of sleep on learning? The current experiment suggests they do not. While typically developing preschoolers showed more retention after a period filled with sleep, children with Down syndrome had greater retention after a period of wakefulness.

## Materials & Procedure 

![Methods](C:\Users\mhorger\Documents\GitHub\Reproducible-Report_Horger\methods.PNG)



The goal of this study was to assess the retention of new words with various intervals between training and test. Children received all conditions 1-2 weeks apart. The conditions included:
1. after a 5 min delay
2. after a nap (4 hour delay)
3. after 24 hours

## Data analysis
The authors assessed the number of trials needed to reach criterion across conditions and groups. 

The first analysis conducted was a repeated measures ANOVA for both wake and nap conditions. The second was a 2x2 ANOVA with delay type as the repeated factor and TD or DS as the between. These were conducted for the 4 and 24 hour delay.

The second was a 2x2 ANOVA with delay type as the repeated factor and TD or DS as the between. These were conducted for the 4 and 24 hour delay. 


We used `r cite_r("r-references.bib")` for all our analyses.

# Discussion
This study challenges the assumption that sleep is beneficial for learning across populations. Contrary to the pattern displayed by typically developing children, children with Down Syndrome showed improved performance during the wake condition as compared to the sleep condition.
